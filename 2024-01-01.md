Learned about lang chain and have been looking into trying to build it.

After deciding to get into Rails, I've decided not to get into it and to try and build some things from scratch.

## Word Count

Spent some time today coding to try and build a word counter to count the words in my blog post... Literally realized later that it could be done in one line in Go:

```
words := strings.Fields(text)
fmt.Printf("\nThere are %d words in the given article.\n", len(words)
```

## Tailwind

I'm going to spend the rest of the night trying to learn how to use Tailwind. Will need to start trying to build my prototype/broilerplate code.

## AI

I learned about LangChain and realized that it's open-source. Would like to try and learn how to build it and run it at home on my machine.

I learned about Mixtral today and read that the model could fit on a single A100. Crazy.

## Blog

I looked into embedding google forms into my blog posts but ended up buying and using SendFox instead. We'll see where that goes.

I don't really want to use substack or anything like that. I want to own what I write on my own platform and I don't intend on charging for what I write.
